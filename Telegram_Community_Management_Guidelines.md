#Community Management Guidelines

These guidelines could go for almost any internet community, but the scope of the document will focus on the vaguely professional world of public cryptocurrency chat groups.

### It's okay to go off topic. 
It's foolish to think that any group can spend prolonged periods discussing a particular topic, without addressing things like "where are you from" or sharing memes, etc. There's always room for personality and personability, and in fact, the "off topic" material is often the best part of many groups. Sociology has found that the most important and productive relationships come from "weak ties," the relationships we have with acquaintances.

### No Word Salad
Word salad is one of the hallmarks of schizophrenia, and probably the easiest thing to spot via text. Word salad adds nothing but noise to a group, and is to be eschewed.

### No discussion of illegal activity
There are methods to evade Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations, but I wouldn't choose to be the resource for users to learn these black arts. This is one of those things where it's much better to leave the rule implicit, otherwise reactance sets in and users will feel obligated to figure out as many illicit possibilities as they can muster.

### No Jerks, No Assholes
There are actually rigorous definitions for what constitutes being an "asshole" or a "jerk."

### Avoid Bullshit
Bullshit, like Jerk and Asshole, actually has a formal and rigorous definition

### Talk like your grandmother will read it (and she knows how to use urban dictionary)
"Keep your words soft and sweet, for one day, you may eat them" 

### Act like your comments will be broadcast in Times Square

### Be thoughtful about Infosec

### Have Fun!!!
